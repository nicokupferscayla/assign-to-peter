# assign to our QA

When deploying to QA, go to the DEPLOY TO ... filter (at the top) and then run this script.

To run it, add a bookmark to your browser with the URL:
`javascript:eval("(jQuery && jQuery.getScript('//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nicokupferscayla/assign-to-peter@latest/script.js'))");`

The button will not be visible _unless_ you are in one of the following two filters: "Ready to deploy QA FE" or "Ready to deploy QA BE".

Go to the RapidBoard and use the filters at the top - and the button will appear
